# phovid

This is a [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) plugin that lets you capture both video and photo input, simultaneously.
While there are a couple plugins for general media capture, there is no plugin that handles all input sources via a single interface.

I initially wrote this for a freelance client, who was using Cordova to build an Instagram-style story creator.

Since I'm not inherently interested in Cordova or Capacitor, I have no intentions on supporting it long term.
But the underlying Swift code is solid, and could easily be retro-fitted as a SwiftPM package.
If anyone wants to take ownership of this project, please reach out!

## Install

```bash
npm install phovid
npx cap sync
```
