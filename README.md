# phovid

This is a [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) plugin that lets you capture both video and photo input, simultaneously.
While there are a couple plugins for general media capture, there is no plugin that handles both.
I initially wrote this for a client, who needed an Instagram-style story creator.

I have no intentions on supporting it long term.
If anyone wants to take ownership of this project, please reach out!

## Install

```bash
npm install phovid
npx cap sync
```
